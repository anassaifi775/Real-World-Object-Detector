# 📌 Real-Time Object & Face Detection using OpenCV and YOLO

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates real-world computer vision applications using both traditional image processing techniques and deep learning-based object detection. It combines OpenCV Haar Cascade classifiers for face and eye detection with YOLOv8 for general object detection.

The project is designed for learning, experimentation, and portfolio demonstration of computer vision concepts using Python.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- NumPy

---

## 🚀 Features
- Face detection using Haar Cascade classifiers
- Eye detection within detected faces
- Object detection using YOLOv8 (pretrained on COCO dataset)
- Bounding boxes and class labels on detected objects
- Image-based detection
- Real-time webcam detection (local execution)
- Clean and modular code structure

---

## ⚠️ Camera & Environment Limitations
Real-time webcam detection **works only in local environments**, such as:
- VS Code
- PyCharm
- Local Jupyter Notebook

Google Colab does **not** support direct webcam access using OpenCV (`cv2.VideoCapture(0)`).

In Google Colab:
- Image-based detection is supported
- Video file–based detection is supported
- Webcam-based real-time detection is **not supported**

## ▶️ How to Run the Project (Local Machine)

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python ultralytics numpy
```

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Script
```bash
python object_detection.py
```

Make sure:
- Your webcam is connected
- You are running the project locally (not on Google Colab)
